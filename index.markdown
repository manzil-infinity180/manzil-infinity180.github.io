My name is Rahul Vishwakarma, and I currently pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from [Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology](http://mmmut.ac.in/).
I am a GSoC contributor to the [Submitty](https://submitty.org/) course management system. My proposal/work has
been in the TA Grading Section.The primary goals for this project include the expansion of our automated testing of the TA Grading pages and to patch bugs uncovered by this improved testing.
